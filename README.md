# VLAD

This is the project based on JÃ©gou et al.'s paper "Aggregating local descriptors
into a compact image presentation"(2010).


This project contains the main (driver file), VLAD class and VLADTrainer class.
Both classes is implemented using OpenCV and works with OpenCV descriptors.
For Mac users, you should be able to build and run the project using the build
script. For Windows users, the directory is set up for Visual Studios project.
I included the property sheet that I used for my VS project.


Requirements: OpenCV with contrib module with NONFREE enabled
